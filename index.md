### 🧠 About Me

<div class="card">
  <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Elizabeth Mansaray</strong>, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a love for uncovering how systems work and how to protect them. My journey began with curiosity - wanting to understand the “why” behind security breaches and how technology can be both powerful and vulnerable at the same time.</p>

  <p>I enjoy working on hands-on labs and projects that explore threat detection, network security, and digital forensics. Whether it’s analyzing packets, configuring firewalls, or investigating a simulated incident, I’m always eager to learn, experiment, and grow so i can help protect data.</p>

  <p>Outside of cybersecurity, I value creativity, storytelling, and the simple joy of building things that make an impact. I’m currently seeking opportunities to contribute to a security team where I can learn, collaborate, and help make systems safer for everyone.</p>
