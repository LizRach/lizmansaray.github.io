### <span class="section-title">🧠 About Me</span>

<div class="card">
  <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Elizabeth Mansaray</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented cybersecurity enthusiast dedicated to protecting digital systems and solving security challenges.</p>

  <p>I enjoy hands-on labs and projects exploring threat detection, network security, and digital forensics. Whether it’s analyzing packets, configuring firewalls, or investigating simulated incidents, I’m always eager to learn, experiment, and grow so I can help protect data.</p>

  <p>Outside of cybersecurity, I value creativity, storytelling, and the simple joy of building things that make an impact. I’m currently seeking opportunities to contribute to a security team where I can learn, collaborate, and help make systems safer for everyone.</p>
